- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

### **Objective/speciality of the printer**: Upside-down style toolchanger printer with belted Z axis

(I'm not sure I'm happy with the name, so it might change in the future)

# 2025. 03. 06. - Big research day
Started planning out the printer (a bit late tbh ðŸ˜…). Done a lot of research today and some CAD work.

The current plan is the following:
- Upside-down design
- Fits into filament box
- 2 extruders with toolchanger
  - mechanical or electrical toolchanger <- to be decided, but mechanical is preferred
- 2020 and 1020 aluminium extrusions for structural rigidity and stability
- 3 linear rails for precise motion on all axes
- 1 belt for X and Y axes and 1 belt for Z axis
- Positron-style XY kinematics
- Positron hotend
- Eddy current bed leveling
- BTT SKR Pico v1.0 controller
- Rasberry Pi Zero 2 W main board
- Integrated power supply
- Enclosure
  - Fitting into the same filament box is preferred, but might not be possible
  - Not 100% planned out yet
  - Might not be included in final design
